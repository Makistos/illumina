The following will generate an int 70 hex (IRQ 8 - RTC) every .976 ms:

	/*
	 * Enable IRQ 8
	 */
	irq_mask=inp(0xA1);
	outp(0xA1,irq_mask&(~1));
	/*
	 * Get RTC register B
	 */
	outp(0x70,0xB);
	rtc_register_b=inp(0x71);
	/*
	 * Set PIE (Periodic Interrupt Enable) bit
	 */
	outp(0x70,0xB);
	outp(0x71,rtc_register_b|0x40);

Hope this helps.
